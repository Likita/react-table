# What I have changed:
- Add Change Randomizer parameters button in Randomize result popup, because it's more convenient to change results
- Show Randomizer parameters in Results

# What's possible to optimize:
- Add Notifications
- Add different DB tables for Teams, roles, statuses. And connect them by id
- Randomize filter by other fields (Role, Status or create list by check each one developer)
- Add Pagination by Backend
- Add Breadcrumbs
- Add Delete user endpoint
- Add errors pages (404)
- Add extra view for View user
- Add extra UI elements from Figma which don't have functionality in the task
- App could use only 1 Dialog and just change content inside
- Split userName into Name and Family name and sort by Family name
- Add tests
